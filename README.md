# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project is a weather-appropriate clothing item manager API. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete clothing items tailored for different weather conditions such as hot, warm, and cold. Users can also like and unlike clothing items, enabling interactive features within the app.

The API provides endpoints to manage users and clothing items, with built-in validation and error handling to ensure robust data management.
